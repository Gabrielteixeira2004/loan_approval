Machine Learning study case for binary classification

## What's next?

Everthing! Just Kidding...

- First Script (Costs and time hyper constrained) + Insights
- Add different models 
- Add hyperparameters tuning (Random Search)
- Add algorithm for preprocessing missing and outliers
- Shap Analysis
- Feature Selection
- Hyperparameters tuning again (Optuna)
- Overfit detection in baseline models
- Stratified KFold for baseline and Stratified Shuffle split for Hyperparamters tuning
